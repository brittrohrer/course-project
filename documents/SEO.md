SEO and Analytics

	SEO is the practice of creating quality and quantity of traffic to your website. The goal is to have organic search results that make up your website traffic.  Each search engine has their own guidelines for success, but all include not tricking the search engines to increase SEO ranking. 

	Search engines have 3 primary functions including crawling, indexing, and ranking. Crawling is when the search engines send out crawlers to find the content like a webpage, image, etc thru links. Indexing is how the content is organized after the crawling process. This indexing leads to the ranking, where the search results are displayed base on relevance. Effective SEO practices contribute to a higher ranking and therefore more traffic.

	There are things, as a developer, that can be done from the beginning to increase your SEO. These include using specific keywords on your webpage. Another way is considering how your content will display in search results. These include title tags, meta descriptions, and even how your data is structured.  Proper use of headers and sub-headers are important because they allow crawlers to effectively move through your page and report it back and determine your relevance to a users search. Links also play a huge part in this and is why navigation through your webpage can also signal the importance of a webpage to the crawlers. 


Proposal for SEO

Things I want to add

    1. Want to add images next to relavent content like the activities page.
    2. Go back into the structure of each page and make sure the header tags are informative of what is in that section.
    3. Make sure the alt text is very descriptive not only for the crawlers but for accessibility with screen readers or failure to load.
    4. Maybe add some links to relavent resources.
    5. Add aria-label to links so they describe what and where they go to.
    6. Add semantic html - replace some divs with applicable article, aside etc tags
    7. Make the website more sharable with good looking content for backlink
    8. Create a 404 page that can link back to the homepage



Things I added

    1. Include Title and Description
        Created default/home title and description and usehead() to chnge the title and description for each page.
    2. Move the navigation outsidde of the header to its own section - so it can be found easier.
